Other Angular developers are making some awesome starter projects. We decided to 
make our own for several reasons 

* Its a great learning experience and we suggest you try it yourself too!  
* We wanted to start with a more bare bones implementation of Angular & Webpack
* Deployments in other starters favor a lot of popular SaSS hosting. This is great, 
but some of our clients deploy in custom environments and need something different.



## Built with

* Angular
* Webpack 2
* Yarn



## Available Yarn Commands

* build     -- builds deploy artifact
