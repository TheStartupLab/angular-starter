## Built with

* [Angular](https://angular.io/)
* [Webpack 2](https://webpack.js.org/)

&nbsp;

## Why Another Starter App? 

There are lots of good ways to go about creating your Angular app with webpack. The [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) from the Angular team scaffolds a project in seconds. 
The popular [angular2-webpack-starter](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter) from the AngularClass has all the bells and whistles you could possibly need. 

We started our own Angular Webpack project to better understand the ins and outs of an Angular + Webpack application. The configuration is similar to those found in both projects. Big thanks to both teams for providing some awesome projects we refrenced when creating our own.
We highly recommend anyone new to Angular or Webpack to do the same!
